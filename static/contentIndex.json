So it doesn’t seem to matter WHAT ROOM it comes from, just if you’ve seen the puzzle.\nFrom “How to solve the two pictures puzzle in Blue Prince” (potential spoilers, I stopped reading once I got the confirmation I needed):\n\nYour task in each room is to look at the two pictures, and subtract the second from the first. The pictures change each day (more on this in a second), so if you get stuck, you can always try again another day.\nFor what it’s worth, not every room has pictures. According to our testing, green rooms like the Veranda or the Patio appear to never have pictures. Some hallways don’t have them. The Foundation doesn’t either. This is only a problem for one day at a time, though, as you’ll solve the pictures puzzle across multiple days.\n\nOkay, so I’m gonna archive the table format I was using lower on the page, and
